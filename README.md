## Story overview
Magical realism creates a sense of wonder and fantasy out of otherwise normal daily events.  From this vantage point, the parallels between the real Capt Piccard of today and the fictional Capt Piccard of 2400 provide a very fertile thematic space in a world where humanity is simultaneously charging towards the collapse of our own planet and colonization of the next one.

This series ties together several of today’s generations around a common question: Has humanity reached the maturity level required to take its steps out into new reaches of the galaxy?  If we can’t find a natural order and balance for our own world, what will that mean for our first footprints onto the next one?

The real Piccard, through his Ted Talks and activism via the [Solar Impulse Foundation](solarimpulse.com/), has demonstrated a proclivity towards the idealism and romanticism required to be the agent and public archetype for developing the moral imperative to colonize new planets.  

However, this challenge really lies in the hands of our children, Generation Z.  Who is the hero of this cause within the Digital Natives?  What great call to adventure will stir the sleeping heroes of tomorrow and help humanity avoid collapse and evolve into a species fit for a planetary expansion?

## Story structure & plot lines
The season finale of Star Trek TNG season 1 tracks 3 characters from the present of the time, 1987.  Those characters: a financier, a housewife and a rock-star were each cryogenically frozen after contracting terminal illnesses.  The genesis of our heroes comes from these roots and must overcome the worldviews and biases while learning important lessons and cultures from them.   This season, similar to Star Wars, a New Hope, only fulfills the call to adventure and crossing of the first threshold.
