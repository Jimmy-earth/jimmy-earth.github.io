<p>As we enter the 3rd decade of the 21st century, the environmentalist movement takes on a very different world from that which it was born into.  Many from the first generation of digital natives (Generation-Z or the zoomers) have grown up viewing the environment primarily through a computer screen.</p>

<p>Many rivers that their parents swam and fished in no longer carry life.  In addition, many youth of today generally take for granted a future with less freedoms and opportunities than their forebears.</p>

<p>Within such a backdrop, the seeker must search deep for the ways &amp; means to overcome and evolve into the next stage of humanity.  The Star Trek series has a tradition of supreme optimism in the basic character of humanity.  The Solar Impulse foundation also attempts to create an air of optimism and positive action towards the environmental challenges of today.  Captains Jean-Luc Piccard &amp; Bertrand Piccard (of the Next Generation and Solar Impulse, respectively) exemplify this idealism in many ways.  Where do we want this optimism to take us?</p>

<p>Humanity appears to be headed into the next steps of its Spacebound journey maybe as early as this decade.  Have we, as a species and culture, developed the character and moral fibre that Star Trek assumed of us?  Or are our leaders getting ready to embark on another round of colonization (smallpox blankets and all)?</p>

<p>Can humanity learn to move past its 20th-century trappings of political dichotomies, growth at any cost &amp; further disconnection with the world and life forces from which it sprung? Or will it instead become a galactic scourge before it gains the maturity required to formulate the Prime Directive?  How will the observers of humanity respond to each of these outcomes?</p>
